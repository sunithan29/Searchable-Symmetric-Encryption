Trapdoor-based Searchable Symmetric Encryption Scheme for Data

In this project, we use trapdoor-based Searchable Symmetric Encryption scheme to query data on the server characterized by attributes using keywords. A trapdoor is generated by the client for every keyword as an input under the master key of the client. This implementation is the interaction between two parties. The client owns the data which is encrypted and uploaded to the server along with its associated search index. After receiving a query with the keyword information from the client, the server runs the SE algorithm and returns a list of identifiers from the document that contains the keyword. This way, the server learns nothing about the index or the keyword of the client.

1. build_index.py: 
   (a)Build an index: To maintain the input record using master key. 
   (b)Generate trapdoor: by the client using master key MK and keyword, w as the input, and outputs the trapdoor of keyword.
2. sse_query.py: Used to search the input file for specific keywords
